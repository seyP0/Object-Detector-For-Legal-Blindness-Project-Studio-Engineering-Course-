**This project is created based on ECE 198 course rubric.**

**Mission**

Our mission is to innovate and create a wearable assistive technology piece that empowers individuals facing visual impairment, more specifically, legal blindness, as a way to enhance their independence and quality of life.

**Problem & Background**

Prior to presenting a possible solution to the above problem, the demographic of this project should be considered. This solution will be based on a research conducted by Roberto Manduchi and Sri Kurniawan, from the Department of Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz. This study presents the findings of a survey conducted with over 300 legally blind or blind individuals, between the ages of 18 to 75, focusing on the frequency, nature, and causes of head-level and fall accidents in the context of independent mobility [22, p. 1]. Within this article, many viable issues are presented, such as:
Head-Level Accidents: Legally blind respondents experienced head-level accidents more frequently than blind respondents. These accidents predominantly occurred outdoors and were caused by objects like tree branches, poles, and signs. Some accidents resulted in medical consequences, changes in walking habits, and reduced confidence in independent travel [22, p. 8].
Trip/Fall Accidents: Legally blind respondents also experienced trip and fall accidents more frequently than blind respondents. The causes included lack of attention, unexpected obstacles, and misjudgment of distances. These accidents often led to similar consequences that were mentioned in the previous point [22, p. 10].
These examples illustrate that legally blind individuals, who make up about 41.7 percent of the 300 individuals surveyed, who still possess some degree of vision, albeit not very clear, tend to be more impacted by obstacles obstructing their path compared to completely blind individuals [22, p. 3]. The study cited above suggests that this discrepancy arises from the fact that legally blind individuals often possess residual vision, such as light perception or a limited visual field [22, p. 3]. This residual vision can inadvertently lead them to place more reliance on their remaining sight, leading them to have fewer visual cues to alert themselves, thus increasing the likelihood of encountering obstacles that they can partially perceive but struggle to fully identify or navigate around [27]. Hence, our clients for this project are the 41.7 percent of the 300 (or 125) legally blind individuals who were studied in this research.

**Solution**

Therefore, as a result, our focus for this project, as mentioned above, is to create an assistive, wearable device that detects objects in one's path, and warns them accordingly via a vibration. With this device, the user is able to explore places hands-free, without any additional, manufactured aid, such as blind canes. We believe that this product will enhance a legally impaired individual's life so that they retain confidence in independent travel. The wearable component of our project will be in the form of a crossbody bag, as we believe that would be more comfortable for the individual to wear, and a bag would allow us to keep all of the components of the project compact in one area, with the exception of the sensor, which will be displayed outside the bag (through a hole) so that it may sense objects.
